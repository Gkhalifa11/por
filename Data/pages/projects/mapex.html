        This project was a collaborative effort in which my team developed an exciting game from scratch. The story follows a cunning criminal on the run, navigating through various levels while evading and battling enemies. Players must strategically defeat foes to collect keys that unlock doors, progressing to new and more challenging environments.

        I was responsible for animation, 3D modeling, and environment design. Using Blender, I crafted detailed character models, animations, and immersive environments, bringing the game's world and characters to life.
